Inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one class acquires all the properties and behaviours/methods of parent class
//except PRIVATE members (fields/methods) and constructors
//you build upon existing classes that are similar
//we can reuse bt word EXTENDS, and inherit properties methods of a class
// inheritance represents IS a relationship.. (parent/child )

ADVANTAGES                   -code re usability-takes less time,
                             -application performance-less memory
                             -execution time is less

DISADVANTAGES               -using inheritance get tightly coupled
                             -if parent class is changed all the subclasses are dependent on it

4 types of inheritance:

//1.single inheritance       -1 parent class and 1 subclass
//2.multilevel inheritance   -1 grandparent class /then parent class then sub/child class
//3.hierarchical inheritance -1 parent class with Multiple subclasses
//4.multiple inheritance     -1 subclass and multiple parent classes -NOT SUPPORTED by classes IN JAVA (only interfaces)
